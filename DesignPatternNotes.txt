Design Pattern Notes

Observer Pattern
When to use
	When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes
		Stock market with thousands of stocks needs to send update to object representing individual stocks
		The Subject (publisher) sends many stocks to the Observers
		The Observers (subscribers) takes the ones they want and use them
